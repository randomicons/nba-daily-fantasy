# nba-daily-fantasy
This is a two part project
## Part One
We want to create a daily fantasy basketball game where people can compete with their friends by setting up a lineup and hoping to beat them in fantasy points.
## Part Two
We want to predict how well a college player will do in their Rookie NBA season.
